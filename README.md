# Description of the project
	 You are on an alien planet planet full creatures made up of basic shapes or simple designs.  Food is around the planet, each food is with a set of body segments or movements it might add to the creature fed. You will be able to pick up the creatures and put them in a fenced area to produce one that has a random selection of features from each parent like a loving happy family.
# Instructions for use
Use the right controller for turning
Use the left controller for moving.
The individual can move around and explore the world.
The individual is able to grab the creatures and put them in the fence for them to breed and create new creatures.
The creatures collect food and gather random body parts and through evolution they change their body

# How it works
### Model combined with camera
A model has been imported from the asset store of a robot.
this Model is then rigged to have both hand movements, leg movements and head movements.
##### Leg Movement 
To get the leg movement working,
We have followed a tutorial to get the legs to move in accordance to the rate of movement of the camera

# Proposal submitted earlier can go here:
	We will be making an alien planet nature simulation. You will be on an alien planet planet full creatures made up of basic shapes or simple designs.  Food will be around the planet, each with a set of body segments or movements it might add to the creature fed. You will be able to pick up the creatures and put them in a fenced area to produce one that has a random selection of features from each parent like a loving happy family.

# Maciej Golubski
 Created assets, the space system,terrain, the creatures and functions related to it, Im really proud of the character swapping body parts, animations and different assets and spawning of creatures. I learned how to effectively swap body parts to a creature spawn
# Luke Hallinan 
 Created movement for creatures, food script and fence mechanism. I am proud of the reproduction inside the fence area. i learned how to edit objects from other objects scripts and edit them.
# Installed packages
Animation rigging 
physics 
probuilder
Artificial intelligence
XR interaction toolkit
Xr plugin management
terrain package
